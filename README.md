# Git-basics-week4
I opened my GitBash terminal and changed my directory to D drive using "cd D:/"

Inside the D drive i created a new folder named Git basics using mkdir 'Git-basics'

Changed my directory into the created folder using 'cd Git-basics'

Then cloned into the repository in github using 'git clone <url>'

changed my directory into the cloned repo using 'cd repo name'

Then created a text file using 'touch hello.txt'

inserted message into it using vim 'vim hello.txt'

'vim hello.txt' opens vim editor and i pressed 'i' to insert into the editor then 'esc' key when am done typing then :wq to save and exit

i then git add . all the changes to stage them

i then committed the changes using git commit -m "my message"

Pushed the changes to the repo using git push origin main

opened the repo in Github and confirmed i ad pushed them successfully!.
